## (Elle) Lou Diane Rigodon

<!---A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved.  And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.--->

I have more than 10 years of experience working in the legal and accounting profession looking for a career change as a software developer. As Steve Jobs once said "the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again". A career in tech will give me the opportunity to be a beginner again, to explore my creative side and my newly found passion for coding.

## Skills
<!---
Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

#### Problem-solving

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)
--->
#### Problem-solving

Legal work requires the ability to identify and process key information and utilize these to come up with the best solution under the circumstances for the client or the organization. I was often tasked to handle legal related operational queries to give advice on the optimal tax strategy for complex commercial transactions.

#### Ability to work under pressure

Tight deadlines and pressure from stakeholders are inevitable working as a lawyer. In my previous jobs, missing deadlines can cost the organization its resources so I had to manage multiple fillings of tax protest and tax returns on top of my day-to-day duties.

#### Team work

As a lawyer, collaborative work is often necessary to achieve the deliverables. This requires coordination with both internal and external parties in various projects which I have been responsible for.

<!---
Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
